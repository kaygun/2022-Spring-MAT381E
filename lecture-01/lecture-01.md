### What is data?

Any collection of symbols can be data as long as they are

- recorded consistently
- collected within the same context
- recalled consistently and accurately

### What is data analysis?

Creates "models" from the data at hand.

### How do we make models?

1. Look at the data, clean it, understand it.
2. Put forth a hypothesis.
3. Choose a model type.
3. Design a fit function.
4. Find the model with optimal parameters.
3. Validate the model.
4. If necessary go back to step 2, 3 or 4.
5. Write a report.

### How is it different than Science?

In any science we do the same.

+ Our domain is fixed.
+ We need deep domain knowledge.
+ Our models are specific to that particular domain.

### How is Data Analysis different than Science?

* Data Analysis models use

  + internal structure of the data
  + are domain agnostic

* Developing these models requires
  - statistical
  - mathematical
  - computational skills
  
### Do we need all of this to do Data Analysis?

* No code no compute!
* No statistics no certainity!
* No mathematics no maintanence!

### Can anyone do Data Analysis without domain knowledge?

Any fool can develop a model! (coding)

### Can anyone do Data Analysis without domain knowledge?

It is difficult to see/decide if

* a model fits (domain knowledge)
* when/where model stops working (math/stats)
* fixing a model when it breaks (math)

### What is a Model?

>  "All models are wrong, but some are useful." George Box

+ Data is usually noisy, complex and hard to understand.
+ Model is an artificial construct.
+ Model is a simplification.

### What does a model do?

- Models can be 
  + predictive 
  + or descriptive.
